# CSE 218_Numerical Methods Python
 This repo contains my codes for offlines, onlines and other practices related to the course CSE 218 Numerical Methods<br />
 
 Here are my implemented codes:
   1. Bisection Method for solving non-linear eqn(Week 3, Week 7)
   2. Newton-Raphson Method for solving non-linear eqn(Week 4)
   3. Gaussian Elimination Method for solving a system of linear eqns(Week 5)
   4. Newton's Divided Difference Method for Interpolation (Week 8)
   5. Lagrange's Method For Interpolation (Week 8)
